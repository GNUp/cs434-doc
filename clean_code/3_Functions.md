# 3. Functions

#### Small!

The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that

The indent level of a function should not be greater than one or two

#### Do One Thing

Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. they should do it only

The reason we write functions is to decompose a larger concept into a set of steps at the next level of abstraction

Another way to know that a function is doing more thatn "one thing" is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation

Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections

#### One Level of Abstraction per Function
