# 2. Meaningful Names

#### Use Intention-Revealing Names

Choosing good names takes time  but saves more than it takes.

Names should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it used.

If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent

### Avoid Disinformation

You should avoid choosing words that are open to interpretation.

Beware of using names which vary in small ways

A truly awful example of dis-informative names would be the use of lower-case L or uppercase O as variable names.

Spelling similar concept similarly is information. Using inconsistent spelling is dis-information

#### Make Meaningful Distinctions

Programmers create problems for themselves when they write code solely to satisfy a compiler or interpreter.

#### Use Pronounceable Names

#### Use Searchable Names

Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text

#### Avoid Encodings

Hungarian Notations, Member Prefixes should be avoided

#### Avoid Mental Mapping

In most context, a single-letter name is a poor choice; it's just a placeholder that the reader must mentally map to the actual concept

> the professional understands that clarity is king

#### Class Names

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names

#### Method Names

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names

#### Don't Be Cute

ex) HolyHandGrenade = DeleteItems, whack = kill, eatMyShorts = abort

Say what you mean. Mean what you say

#### Pick One Word per Concept

Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it

#### Don't Pun

Avoid using the same word for two purposes

#### Use Solution Domain Names

Choosing technical names is usually the most appropriate course

#### Use Problem Domain Names

The code that has more to do with problem domain concepts should have names drawn from the problem domain

#### Add Meaningful Context

> It will pay off in the short term and continue to pay in the long run
