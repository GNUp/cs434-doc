# 4. Comments

“Don’t comment bad code—rewrite it.”

* The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.

* Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all.

* Truth can only be found in one place: the code

## Good Comments

* The only truly good comment is the comment you found a way not to write
* Sometimes a comment goes beyond just useful information about the implementation and provides the intent behind a decision
* Sometimes it is useful to warn other programmers
  about certain consequences
* It is sometimes reasonable to leave “To do” notes in the form of //TODO comments

## Bad Comments

* Mumbling
* Redundant Comments
* Misleading Comments
* Mandated Comments
* Journal Comments
* Noise Comments
* Don’t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable
* Position Markers
* Closing Brace Comments
* Attributions and Bylines
* Commented-Out Code
* HTML Comments
* Nonlocal Information
* Too Much Information
* Inobvious Connection
* Function Headers
* Javadocs in Nonpublic Code
